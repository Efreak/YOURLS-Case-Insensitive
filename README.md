YOURLS Case Insensitive Plugin
==============================

Makes all keywords case insensitive (creates all keywords and calls all keywords lowercase.) Only works if you are using Base 36. Fixes disappearing capital letters.

Installation
------------

Move the `case-insensitive` folder into the `/users/plugins` folder. Then, activate the plugin in the admin interface. That's all there is to it.

Requirements
------------

User must have a YOURLS 1.5+ nightly installed. You can either [install from SVN](http://code.google.com/p/yourls/wiki/InstallFromSVN), or [download and install a zip archive](http://yourls.org/nightly-builds/).

Bonus
-----

Works with [YOURLS QR Code Plugin](https://github.com/seandrickson/yourls-qrcode-plugin) to generate smaller QR codes!
